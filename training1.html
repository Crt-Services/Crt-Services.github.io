CRT is proud to be an ABB Channel Partner and a champion of the Flow-X Flow Computer.

                We’ll be hosting a mixer the first night of training.  Everyone is invited to stay at the brewery for some food, fun, and drinks.  It will be a great opportunity to network with other measurement professionals in our industry.  You’re not obligated to stay but we hope you do!
